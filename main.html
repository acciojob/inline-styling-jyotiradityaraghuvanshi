		<p>The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the 
			individual and the species. All flowering plants are heterosporous
			, that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores.
			<br>Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers and megaspores 
			are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary.</p>
